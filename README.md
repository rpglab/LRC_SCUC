## Model-based Inertia-constrained LRC-SCUC

This set of codes implements our TPWRS paper "Security-Constrained Unit Commitment Considering Locational Frequency Stability in Low-Inertia Power Grids". 

The proposed locational-RoCoF-constrained security-constrained unit commitment (LRC-SCUC) model along with supporting methods are implemented, as well as two benchmark models. 

The novel LRC-SCUC model can ensure the optimal day-ahead scheduling solutions to meet (synchronous) inertia-related frequency stability requirements. 

Time-domain simulations were performed to validate the LRC-SCUC solutions.


## Introduction:
* Two benchmark models: 
	* a traditional security-constrained unit commitment (T-SCUC).
	* an equivalent-RoCoF-constrained unit commitment (ERC-SCUC).
* The locational RoCoF constraints are derived from reduced IEEE 24-bus system dynamic models. Two RoCoF measuring windows (t1 = 0 and t2 = 0.5) are introduced to handle the oscillation in power system.
* Piecewise Linaerization Method (PWL) is used to linearize the original nonlinear locational RoCoF concstraints. 
* The test case includes time series profiles of renewable generation, electrical load.
* Multiple evaluation points combinations are set to reduce the PWL approximation errors.

## Steps to run SCUC simulation:
1. Set up the python environment.
2. Set the solver location: 'UC_function.py'=>'solve_UC' function=>UC_solver=SolverFactory('solver_name',executable='solver_location')
3. Run 'RoCoF_PWL_fitting.py': generate PWL coefficients for each generator bus.
4. Run SCUC models to get simulation results of test case.
